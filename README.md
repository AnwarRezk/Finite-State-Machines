# Finite-State-Machines
Finite State Machine is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two types deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines.
# Determisitc-Finite-Automata
It's a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects a given string of symbols, by running through a state sequence uniquely determined by the string.
